# SpellCheck_AutoComplete
Spell Check and Auto Complete implemented using different data strcutures (linked lists, tries, binary search trees, hashmaps, and Queues/Stacks). Code shell for the Data Structures classes inspired from UCSD's Coursera Course on Data Structures. However, all data structures and algorithms were implemented by me.

App.java has the Spellcheck and Autocomplete program. Other Java files are supporting data structures classes used by App.java
